Hi !! I'm Samantha. It's been killing me that I haven't been able to tell you this sooner but you remind me so much of Cameron from Halt and Catch Fire. Really you're just both blonde with compsci genius but its something I can't unsee. 

I played softball for like 10 years of my life and loved it but I am on the rowing team now. I learned to pitch my sophomore year of high school during covid in an old cattle barn with an 80 y/o man. That spring I hit 7 batters in the first inning of our first game... so I went back to playing first while I practiced more and the following spring was totally different.

Also... I was really scared for this class and had really low expectations but after our first class I'm really really excited. I had a awful horrible terrible intro to programing experience and haven't loved coding since... I did love Melissa's class and I really like HTML and CSS so hopefully I leave with course with a better relationship with coding.
